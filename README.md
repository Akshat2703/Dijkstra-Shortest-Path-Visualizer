Welcome to Dijkstra Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated the way Dijkstra works, and just wanted to visulize this in C++
using the old school graphics library. 
I have tried to bring the theoretical concept into a visualization application, and has shown the basic idea behind the Dijkstra Algorithm.

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
